## Overview
This project is a Point of Sale (POS) web application developed using React. It allows users to record sales transactions, manage product sales, and analyze sales performance through clear summaries, tables, and interactive charts.

## Feature-Dashboard
The app features a dashboard that displays total revenue, number of transactions, and total items sold. It also includes sales trend analysis (daily, weekly, and monthly), sales by category with multiple chart views (pie, bar, and horizontal bar), and a top-selling products list.
